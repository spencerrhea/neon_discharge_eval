This repo is used to evaluate the NEON continuous discharge product

The code here can be downloaded and run to update this evaluation for future neon releases. To do so: download the src/neon_discharge_eval.R script, change the neon_release argument to the desired data release, and run the script.
To set custom quality thresholds for binning data, use the function in src/set_q_criteria.R
